<H3>South Afternoon</H3><PRE>Dazzling pink flamencos
An hombre with sombrero
Brings an iced green drink with a crisp tortilla
A tropical revival lovely day

Thoughts and polished beauty
Whole vacation feeling
Discovering this day is filtered through a plastic screen
Cineramic landscape
Wilderness is fiction
Quartz sun rays highlight its pure form

I see my thoughts in the still southafternoon
While time goes by, Sunday is near the end
Life span in a Holiday Inn

Green electric leaves
Many perfect palms
Small triangled sails slide on a chlorine blue sea
Artificial rainbows
Colours have their wavelength
Seagulls draw a diagram up high

Just the right environment
To learn intensive Spanish
High degree of speed of syntax falling in place
Words are learned with ease
El hombre habla idiomas
Mejor hablan las computadoras

I see my thoughts in the still southafternoon
While time goes by, Sunday is near the end
Life span in a Holiday Inn

Sitting on a patio
I scan a glowing terminal
Sipping liquide phonemes with my mint-iced green drink
Computer has the angles
To teach us with facility
A tropical revival lovely day

I see my thoughts in the still southafternoon
While time goes by, Sunday is near the end
Life span in a Holiday Inn

<H3>My time</H3><PRE>
Stored on the shelves of my memory
my thoughts are in perfect array

My life runs smooth like a highway
billboards show me the way

My way of life has the glamour
of an artificial neon ad

I need overwhelming information
for a complete shopping list

Acrylic colours oscillate my eyes
when I wal down a drugstore aisle

My time my time I love my time
My time has something more
My time's the best there's ever been
My time I love my time
Thank you my time

Stored on the shelves of my memory
my thoughts are in perfect array

I learn do it yourself cybernetics
while I'm jogging on a rolling tray

I love my weekends in the pure air
on the heights of the Eiffel tower

My time my time I love my time
My time has something more
My time's the best there's ever been
My time I love my time
Thank you my time

My life runs smooth like a highway
billboards show me the way

My love stories have the flavour
of a swiss made digital watch

When I have to know what to love
I recall my stored data

My time my time I love my time
My time has something more
My time's the best there's ever been
My time I love my time
Thank you my time

My thoughts are still like a photo
in the hall of a Hilton Hotel

My reflex actions are mechanized
like japanese camera tourists

happily milling in Bloomingdales
shooting at beautiful symbols

My time my time I love my time
My time has something more
My time's the best there's ever been
My time I love my time
Thank you my time

<H3>Quite still</H3><PRE>
Quite still
I watch the outlines of thoughts
While around shallow words I speak and hear
Move but don't interfere

Swaying curves
Like arms moving slow and precise
A point where the light starts dripping down
While the radio speaks out

I run my finger along my thoughts
My mind sweeping with geometrical force
Remote image, yet so close
Sliding through memory
Defining my days like laser beams

Deep looks
Surfacing voice on the phone
But my thoughts is as sharp as an ad
Reaching the target precise

Flue image
Hallucinating my life
Like celluloid loves
While I watch
Alone my flat TV set

I run my finger along my thoughts
My mind sweeping with geometrical force
Remote image, yet so close
Sliding through memory
Defining my days like laser beams

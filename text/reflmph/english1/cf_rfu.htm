	The <a href="sheldrak.htm">principle of formative causality</a> can be explained very simply by the <a href="hum.htm">hypothesis of mathematical universes</a> and the <a href="rfu.htm">ramification of universes bundles</a> without using the notion of a propagating morphic field : when a physical object placed in some conditions has some behaviour in one of the branches of the ramifications, this means that in this branch the laws of physics are such that it could only have this behaviour, and the same laws will of coulse apply also to a similar object which will be in similar conditions, similar causes producing similar effects.

Physicists have noticed that the laws of physics which modelize our perceptions are exactly the ones that suit to permit apparition of highly complex structures permitting the existence of very complex life forms
<!--d'une vie intelligente.>
It would have been sufficient that these laws have been very slightly different to give a universe without interest. Can we conclude to the existence of a supreme being which would have determinated the laws of physics which permit the apparition of complex life forms?
<!--qui aurait délibérément choisi ces lois de
façon à permettre l'apparition de l'homme?> 
This is not the only possible explanation of 
            <!-- Une explication  a été  proposée pour  expliquer> 
this "anthropic principle" according to which the universe seems to be made for complex life.
<p>
According to <a href="hmm.htm">the many worlds hypothesis</a>, <!--permet d'imaginer qu'>
there would exist an infinity of universes, one for each possible set of physical laws. 
In most of these universes no complex life can appear, and there would be nobody to ask this kind of questions. In the few universes which permit apparition of complex life, intelligent beings would ask themselves by which miracle the laws of physics are exactly the good ones permitting them to exist.

The many worlds hypothesis permits to explain the non-determinism of quantum physics without resorting to random, by supposing that when the wave function collapses, the universe "ramifies".
<p>
	According to this hypothesis, each time a choice is possible, the universe is separated into several parallel universes, one for each possible choice.
	Then, the notion of choice is an illusion. Let us suppose for example that I can chose between A and B and that I chose A. In fact it is only in this world that I chose A. In another parallel universe, I or rather my duplicate has chosen B. I have the impression that only this world is real and the other is only hypothetical, but my duplicate has the impression that his world is real and my world is hypothetical. In fact in the absolute all worlds are as real. <p>
 
	One could then conceive that the tree structure of all possible worlds would be entirely predeterminated, and that we have an impression of free will, which would come from the fact that we perceive only one branch of this tree structure, and this branch is not predeterminated. <p>

	The many worlds hypothesis also permits to imagine that there exists an infinity of universes, one for each possible set of physical laws, giving an explanation to the 
<a href="panthrop.htm">anthropic principle</a>.
<p>
<!-- et que dans les rares univers propices à l'apparition de la vie
tels que le n&ograve;tre des êtres intelligents se demandent pourquoi les lois de
la physique leur ont permis d'exister alors que dans les autres univers il
n'y a pas d'être vivant assez intelligent pour se demander quoi que ce
soit de ce genre.-->
 <p>
	Some people reject this explanation because they consider that resort to universes to which we cannot access, and which from our viewpoint does not really exist, complicates the things.	
But as <!--je l'ai  remarqué-->we saw it previously, the only true reality is our consciousness, our perception and action at present time; all the remainder is <a href="regul.htm">mental construction</a>; and this construction has to be the most simple which agrees with experience. 
<!--From the viewpoint of this many worlds theory, for those who live in one of these parallel universes,
D'autre part, du point de vue de cette
       théorie des mondes multiples,  pour ceux qui  vivraient dans un de
       ces univers parallèles,  c'est cet univers  qui apparaitrait comme
       réel,  les  autres  dont  le  n&ograve;tre  apparaissant  comme virtuels,
       fictifs.-->
Paradoxically, the many worlds theory is not more complicated but is simpler than the theory of the unique universe, if we look from the adequate viewpoint, if we consider the 
<a href="regul.htm">"germ"</a> and not its unfolding : the "germ" of all possible universes
 <!--ne comprend que   26 lettres alors que celui
       de  notre  univers  particulier  pourrait  bien  en  comporter une
       infinité.-->
is smaller than the "germ" of a particular universe like our universe. One formulation would be the phrase "For each possible mathematical model of a world, there exist a corresponding physical world." is probably shorter than a hypothetic book of physics describing the "theory of everything" of our world, theory that remains to be discovered and that could be 
<a href="naturesp.htm">infinite</a>.

            Cette hypothèse  des mondes multiples pourrait s'expliquer  de façon  plus précise
       par (a href="sheldrak.htm")la théorie  des champs  morphiques et de la causalité formative du  biologiste et physicien
       anglais Rupert Sheldrake(/a).
